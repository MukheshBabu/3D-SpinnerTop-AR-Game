# 3D-SpinnerTop-AR-Game


This game is a Beyblade Augmented Reality game that will be playable on mobile devices. The game will utilize AR technology to bring the Beyblade spinner top battles to life in a virtual environment. Anyone will be able to battle other players online and the game will have realistic physics. We'll use Unity to make the game, and AR technology to detect surfaces and scale the virtual objects.



## Tech Stack

**Tool:** Unity (Game Engine), Photon (Unity networking), ARCore

**Programming Language:** C#


## Installation

```bash

## About Unity Game Engine
- Unity is a popular and widely used game engine developed by Unity Technologies.
- It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for creating both 2D and 3D games, simulations, and interactive experiences.
- Unity supports multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, consoles, mobile devices (iOS and Android), VR/AR devices, and web browsers.
- It uses a component-based approach, where game objects are built by attaching various components to them, such as renderers, colliders, scripts, and more.
- Unity offers a visual editor that allows developers to design scenes, place objects, and configure properties without writing code.
- Unity provides a robust physics engine for realistic simulations of object interactions, including gravity, collisions, and rigid body dynamics.
- It offers a powerful animation system for creating complex animations and controlling object movements.
- Unity supports asset importing, allowing developers to import various types of assets like 3D models, textures, audio files, and animations.
## About Photon (unity networking)
Photon Unity Networking (PUN) is a popular networking solution for Unity game development. It is developed by Exit Games and built on top of the Photon Cloud infrastructure, which provides server hosting and matchmaking services.
Photon Unity Networking simplifies the process of adding multiplayer functionality to Unity games, providing a reliable and scalable networking solution. With its features and ease of use, PUN has become a popular choice for developers looking to create multiplayer experiences in their Unity projects.

- **Multiplayer Networking :** PUN allows developers to easily implement multiplayer functionality in their Unity games. It provides a high-level API that abstracts the complexities of networking, allowing developers to focus on game logic and design.

- **Pricing Model :** PUN offers a tiered pricing model based on the number of concurrent users and additional features required. It provides different plans suitable for small indie projects to large-scale commercial games.
## ARCore
ARCore is a software development kit (SDK) developed by Google that enables augmented reality (AR) experiences on Android devices. When integrated with Unity, ARCore allows developers to create AR applications and games.

- **Augmented Reality (AR) Technology :** ARCore utilizes computer vision and motion tracking to understand the real-world environment and place virtual objects within it. It enables developers to overlay digital content on top of the real world, creating immersive AR experiences.

- **Unity Integration :** ARCore provides a Unity package that integrates with the Unity game engine. This package includes scripts, prefabs, and examples that help developers quickly incorporate AR functionality into their Unity projects.
